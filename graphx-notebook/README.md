## Info

This is the docker image with a spark-notebook using the GraphX.

### Building

```bash
make build
```
This will build a docker image with the notebook and the example data. It assumes
the parquet data generated by the converter.
Some example data can be found in `../parquet-converter/data/example1/output/`, but
I suggest creating own from the `~/.bitcoin/blocks/blk00xyz.dat` files using the
`parquet-converter`.

### Running

```bash
make open run
```

Then the notebook is listening on http://localhost:9000.
